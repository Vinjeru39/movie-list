There he encountered so much hardship it is amazing he didn\'t abandon his mission and go home. But he stayed for over 40 years. One issue that tormented him was sati‚Äîthe burning alive of widows when their husbands died. He would not rest until this practice was stopped. Facing insurmountable odds, he "plodded" on to influence the abolition of sati and to become the revered "Friend of India" and "Father of Modern Missions." He oversaw more translations of the Bible than had been done in all previous Christian history combined. Life was never easy for Carey. But he simply refused to quit, even when a devastating fire destroyed years of his literary work. His legacy has inspired countless others from his own day to the present. William Carey shows dramatically how a life dedicated to God and obedient to His calling can make a profound difference in the world.

His convictions cost him his life.\n\nWhat is a moral person to do in a time of savage immorality? That question tormented Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German clergyman of great distinction who actively opposed Hitler and the Nazis.  His convictions cost him his life.  The Nazis hanged him on April 9, 1945, less than a month before the end of the war.  Bonhoeffer's last years, his participation in the German resistance and his moral struggle are dramatized in this film.  More than just a biographical portrait, Bonhoeffer: Agent of Grace sheds light on the little-known efforts of the German resistance.  It brings to a wide audience the heroic rebellion of Bonhoeffer, a highly regarded Lutheran minister who could have kept his peace and saved his life on several occasions but instead paid the ultimate price for his beliefs.\n\nDirector: Eric Till\nStarring: Ulrich Tukur, Johanna Klante, Robert Joy",
